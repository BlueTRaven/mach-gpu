The WebGPU interface for Zig - providing a truly cross-platform graphics API for Zig (desktop, mobile, and web) with unified low-level graphics & compute backed by Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL (as a best-effort fallback.)

## Features

* Desktop, Steam Deck, (soon) web, and (future) mobile support.
* A modern graphics API similar to Metal, Vulkan, and DirectX 12. 
* Cross-platform shading language
* Compute shaders
* Seamless cross-compilation & zero-fuss installation, as with all Mach libraries.
